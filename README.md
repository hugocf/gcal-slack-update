# Gcal âž” Slack

`gcal-slack-update` automatically changes your status in multiple Slack teams, depending on the _current_ event in your Google Calendar.

It is designed to run periodically from a `cron` job and, during each execution, it checks whether the current event *Title* in Google Calendar contains the `match-text` defined in the set of configuration rules received as input.

Example of an input file in `rules-example.conf`:

```ini
rules = [
  {
    match-text = "testing this"
    status-emoji = ":smile:"
    status-text = "It works"
  }, 
  {
    match-text = "another test"
    status-emoji = ":+1:"
    status-text = "Count me in"
  },
]
```

| Configurations | Description                              | Maps toâ€¦                     |
| -------------- | ---------------------------------------- | ---------------------------- |
| `match-text`   | Case insensitive string which can appear anywhere in the searched field | **Google Calendar**: Event Title |
| `status-emoji` | The symbol to display as the status      | **Slack**: Status Emoji          |
| `status-text`  | The statusâ€™ description (can also contain emojis) | **Slack**: Status Text           |

Authentication is read from a file named `auth.conf` (see example in `auth-example.conf`):

```ini
slack-token = "xoxp-legacy-token"
```

To generate such a token, go to the [legacy tokens](https://api.slack.com/custom-integrations/legacy-tokens#legacy-info) Slack page of the workspace where you wish to update the status.
